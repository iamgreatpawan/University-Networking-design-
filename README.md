Simulation and Design of University Area Network Scenario (UANS) using Cisco Packet Tracer.
A university network has several uses such as teaching,
learning, result publishing, resource sharing, file sharing,
communication, etc. The University Area Network design
is about designing a topology of a network that is a LAN
(Local Area Network) for a university in which various
computers of different departments and buildings are
set up so that they can interact and communicate with
each other by interchanging data.
